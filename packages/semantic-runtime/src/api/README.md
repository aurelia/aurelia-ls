# Semantic Runtime API

See [../README.md](../README.md) for the folder-wide rebuild map and Atlas and auLink rule.

This folder owns the in-process API boundary for opening an Aurelia app with the semantic runtime. It is a library
surface, not a daemon, CLI, or snapshot format.

The API should stay close to the typed substrate. It may compose boot, evaluation, configuration, DI, resource,
compiler, rendering, and TypeChecker-backed products, but it should not recreate those layers as private summary tables.
When an answer becomes awkward, prefer improving the underlying product records or adding a narrow query projection over
building compatibility glue here.

Keep `runtime.ts` as the boot/app facade. Public query enums, answer envelopes, row interfaces, and result interfaces
belong in `contracts.ts`; row projection helpers that are already specific to one substrate family should live in
focused modules such as `binding-projections.ts`, so expanding the authoring API does not turn the facade into a second
materializer.

## Shape

Use `createSemanticRuntime(...)` to boot a workspace, then `runtime.openApp(...)` to materialize the current app-world
view for one project. `SemanticApp.ask(...)` accepts a small query envelope for app facts, while named methods such as
`summary()`, `appTopology(...)`, `resourceVisibility(...)`, `templateCompilations(...)`,
`runtimeControllers(...)`, `bindingTargetAccesses(...)`, `targetOperations(...)`, `bindingTargetOperations(...)`,
`bindingSourceOperations(...)`, `bindingValueChannels(...)`, and `bindingDataFlows(...)` are available for TypeScript
callers.
One runtime instance memoizes opened app-worlds by project key; create a fresh runtime for an edit/reopen cycle that
needs new source admission.

Rows default to compact source labels and counts. Opaque kernel handles are intentionally opt-in through
`SemanticRuntimeDetail.Handles`; they are useful for exact in-process follow-up navigation but too noisy for initial
answers. Paged app rows return semantic row-key cursors rather than numeric offsets wherever the API owns the paging
projection, so follow-up reads remain meaningful after unrelated rows are inserted earlier in the same sorted answer.

```ts
import {
  createSemanticRuntime,
  SemanticAppQueryKind,
  SemanticRuntimeDetail,
} from '@aurelia-ls/semantic-runtime';

const runtime = await createSemanticRuntime({ workspaceRoot: 'path/to/app' });
const app = await runtime.openApp();

const overview = app.ask({ kind: SemanticAppQueryKind.Summary });
const topology = app.ask({ kind: SemanticAppQueryKind.AppTopology });
const templates = app.ask({
  kind: SemanticAppQueryKind.TemplateCompilations,
  page: { size: 20 },
});
const exactTemplateRows = app.ask({
  kind: SemanticAppQueryKind.TemplateCompilations,
  page: { size: 5 },
  detail: SemanticRuntimeDetail.Handles,
});
const controllerRows = app.ask({
  kind: SemanticAppQueryKind.RuntimeControllers,
  detail: SemanticRuntimeDetail.Handles,
});
const targetAccessRows = app.ask({
  kind: SemanticAppQueryKind.BindingTargetAccesses,
});
const targetOperationRows = app.ask({
  kind: SemanticAppQueryKind.TargetOperations,
});
const sourceOperationRows = app.ask({
  kind: SemanticAppQueryKind.BindingSourceOperations,
});
const valueChannelRows = app.ask({
  kind: SemanticAppQueryKind.BindingValueChannels,
});
const dataFlowRows = app.ask({
  kind: SemanticAppQueryKind.BindingDataFlows,
});
```

`AppTopology` is the first app-building projection. It composes already-materialized configuration, resource, compiler,
and template facts into app roots, components, bindables, component dependencies, external template assets, and roleful
source files. Conventional state, service, and model support files are surfaced as source roles so app-building plans can
verify the shape they asked for without treating those files as Aurelia resources. Keep the projection verification-
oriented: if a future authoring plan cannot be checked by this projection or another narrow semantic answer, improve the
substrate before adding source-generation convenience.

Summary and template-compilation rows now distinguish configuration DI containers from renderer-created runtime child
containers. Use `runtimeChildContainers` and `runtimeChildContextResolverSlots` as the compact pressure signal for
whether component/template-controller rendering has closed enough container shape for deeper DI answers.

`RuntimeControllers` exposes controller frames created or reached during runtime `Rendering`, including the resource
definition, creating instruction, parent/child counts, binding count, scope presence, template-controller flow/cardinality
semantics, a compact controller readiness value, a compressed lifecycle timeline, and the recursive hydration handoff
that is currently modeled. Lifecycle timeline rows are consecutive-step aggregates over the framework-shaped events the
semantic runtime can currently see: controller creation, child-container setup, `Controller.addChild`,
`Controller.addBinding`, `IViewFactory` creation, synthetic-view creation, `Rendering.render`, Scope attachment, and
`Controller.bind`. Custom-element controllers report
`compiled-template` when the controller has a first-class `ControllerUsesCompiledTemplate` claim. Template-controller
controllers report `instruction-sequence` when their hydration instruction owns a nested child sequence and expose the
modeled `IViewFactory` association. The factory carries a generated embedded custom-element definition product, creates
an aggregate `synthetic-view` controller row for the `IViewFactory.create(...) -> Controller.$view(...) ->
_hydrateSynthetic() -> Rendering.render(...)` pass, and publishes both definition and instruction-sequence claims.
Aggregate rows are intentionally cardinality-aware rather than instance-precise: `repeat` still reports `many`, while
`if` and promise branches report their optional/single branch shape. Template-controller branch rows also expose
`templateControllerLinkKind` and `linkedTemplateControllerName` when Aurelia's `link(...)` hook connects them to a
controlling template controller, such as `else -> if` or `then/catch -> promise`.

`BindingTargetAccesses` exposes target-side accessor/observer lookup selected during `Controller.bind` for runtime
property bindings and interpolations: accessor versus observer lookup, target kind, target property, selected built-in
strategy, DOM events, target/property type displays, writability, observability, authority, source address, and optional
handles. This is the compact authoring pressure signal for form controls, class/style property access, and later
TS-backed source/target flow through ObserverLocator-shaped semantics. Standards-shaped attribute access such as
`data-*`, `aria-*`, and generated SVG-analyzer attributes reports the `data-attribute-accessor` strategy, matching
Aurelia's `NodeObserverLocator` routing.

`TargetOperations` exposes direct target updates that do not ask `ObserverLocator`. Rows include an owner lane:
renderer-owned operations from `SetPropertyRenderer`, `SetAttributeRenderer`, `SetClassAttributeRenderer`, and
`SetStyleAttributeRenderer`, plus binding-owned operations from `AttributeBinding.updateTarget(...)` for `.class`,
`.style`, ordinary attribute writes, `ContentBinding.updateTarget(...)` for text content writes, and
`ListenerBinding.bind(...)` for event listener subscription. Rows report owner kind, binding/renderer kind, target
attribute, target property/token/key, static value when one exists, operation kind, affected names, authority, source
address, optional handles, and row-local open pressure. `BindingTargetOperations` remains as a compatibility entrypoint
for the same projection while callers migrate to the broader name.

`BindingSourceOperations` exposes source-side binding behavior that should not be squeezed into DOM target updates.
`RefBinding.updateSource(...)` publishes a `ref-assign-target` operation after resolving Aurelia's ref target lane:
`element` returns the authored node, `component`/named custom elements return a controller view-model, custom attribute
names return the custom attribute view-model, `controller` returns the controller product, and unsupported `view.ref`
stays open. These rows are consumed by value-channel and data-flow projections as `ref-target` target-to-source flow.

`BindingValueChannels` exposes the observer/accessor or direct-operation value shape that runtime data flow should use
instead of blindly treating the raw DOM property as the transported value. Static single-select options now surface a
literal value domain such as `'ship' | 'pickup'`, and expression-backed `model.bind`/`value.bind` can supply option,
radio, and checkbox element values through the lowered sibling binding products. `checked.bind` surfaces boolean,
radio-value, and checkbox array/set-membership branches. Static multi-selects expose selected option element domains for
array sources, while dynamic `multiple.bind`, non-literal dynamic element values, custom matcher semantics, and map
key/value modes should stay visible as channel pressure until their observer semantics are closed.
Class/style value channels report `class.bind` and class interpolation token channels, `.class` toggle channels with
their toggled class names, `style.bind` and style interpolation rule channels, and `.style` property channels with the
targeted CSS property. Text interpolation through `ContentBinding` reports `text-content` channels backed by
`text-content-set` target operations. `SpreadValueBinding` reports the target/value shape of its per-bindable inner
`PropertyBinding` fan-out when the target component's bindable keys are statically known, instead of pretending that
`...$bindables` is a static DOM property. `SpreadBinding`-owned inner bindings created from captured `...$attrs` are
reported through the same target-access, target-operation, value-channel, and data-flow projections as ordinary
bindings, while their ownership remains a binding-to-binding runtime claim under the hood.

`BindingDataFlows` exposes the source/target edge after scopes plus target access or target operation are materialized.
Rows report binding direction, source expression lane/name/type, raw target property type, observer/direct-operation
runtime value type, source writability for target-to-source flows, TypeChecker assignability checks in the active
directions, source address, optional handles, and row-local open pressure. This is the compact pressure signal for
two-way form controls, setter-backed state, class/style presentation bindings, template-controller value bindings, and
future validation/write diagnostics. Direct spread value bindings appear here as source-to-target flow from each spread
object property into the corresponding target bindable, such as `featuredCardBindings.productId -> productId`.
Captured `...$attrs` flows appear as the concrete inner binding that `TemplateCompiler.compileSpread(...)` produced,
for example a forwarded `disabled.bind="false"` reporting boolean-to-boolean flow on the inner input element. Captured
parent expressions can also surface here: the storefront `field-shell` wrapper reports forwarded `value.bind="email"`
as an inner input value flow typed against the checkout-form parent scope.

## Fixture Pressure

Authoring fixtures live under `../../fixtures/authoring`. They should look like code we would be comfortable
recommending to Aurelia users, even when that makes the semantic runtime work harder. See
[../authoring/README.md](../authoring/README.md) and [../application/README.md](../application/README.md) for the
authoring/topology boundaries behind those fixtures.

Analyzer stress fixtures should be separate from authoring fixtures. Avoid adding brittle golden snapshots around either
kind of fixture; the valuable signal is whether the API can expose precise, navigable open seams and compact high-level
answers after the app is reopened.
